# VM Computers 
###### I spent my whole quarantine working on this.
#### Made with the SDK of and tested with VirtualBox 6.1.8, you need a VirtualBox version that starts with "6.1" for the mod to work.
#### Install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) for Minecraft 1.16.5 and [the Fabric API mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to load the mod .jar (.jar goes in .minecraft/mods)
#### You can donate in BTC to the address 3GubEkHV69gCkjWhRgRWYqWqyjcWW3gxFF or in BCH to bitcoincash:qq6jttzlvgj68lvecnh75pt3znezj4vx6sysfvj3j5

#### 3) The rest is self-explanatory.
### Creating a Hard Drive / Importing an ISO
ISOs are located at `[minecraft folder]/vm_computers/isos`. Place your ISOs in there and you will be able to select them in the PC case menu. Virtual Hard Drives are created by rightclicking with a hard drive in your hand. It doesn't matter if it's already assigned to a file or not, it will always open the menu. You can either use an existing hard drive (located in `[minecraft folder]/vm_computers/vhds`) or create a new one.
### Building the Computer
##### You need a PC case, a motherboard, RAM, a CPU, a GPU and a screen. The keyboard and mouse are only decorative and you can start the VM without a hard drive or ISO inserted.
##### To insert a hard drive, you need to create one by rightclicking with a hard drive in your hand. It doesn't matter if it's already assigned to a file or not.
#### 1) Place down the case.

#### 4) Open the case.

###### The buttons are greyed out if you don't own the according item.
#### 5) I hope that the rest is self-explanatory.
### Using the computer
Right click the screen while the computer is turned on (which you do in the pc case menu) and your input is focused to the VM. Key combinations do still work on your host computer, e.g. if you press Alt+F4 the game will close. To unfocus, do the key combination mentioned at the top left corner.
